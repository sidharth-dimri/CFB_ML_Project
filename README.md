The following repository consists of 4 files


The first is a paper recording my experiment and explaining the methodology behind my experiment.

The second is the code to my entire project, including my brainstorming process, testing, and validation methods.

The third is a trial version of my project, which allows you to try out the final product for yourself. You can find the FPI, Bowl Game chance, and Playoff chance for all teams, or just your favorite one

The final file is a csv containing the dataset I used for this project
